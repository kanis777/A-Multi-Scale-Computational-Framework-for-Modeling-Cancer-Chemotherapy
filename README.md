# A-Multi-Scale-Computational-Framework-for-Modeling-Cancer-Chemotherapy
A multi-scale computational framework for modeling cancer chemotherapy, extending the deterministic ODE model from Lestari et al. (2019). Implements a Stochastic (SDE) model for biological randomness and a Network-Hybrid (Agent-Based) model for spatial dynamics.
